              A: Registration is not required. Just configure your miner
              according to our instructions and start mining. <br>Your
              first submitted share will automatically register you
              with our pool. Good Luck!

              Q: Why is my reported hashrate zero or different from what
              my miner reports?
            </h4>
            <p>
              A: Pool and miner hashrates are re-calculated every ten
              minutes.<br> Therefore it can take a maximum of ten minutes
              for your hashrate to update depending on the submission
              time of your first valid share. <br>The hashrate we display
              at the pool is a rough approximation of your hashrate
              based on your submitted shares <br>and can therefore differ
              significantly from the hashrate displayed locally. When
              in doubt always consider the value displayed by your
              miner as the correct one.

            <h4>Q: How will I get paid?</h4>
            <p>
              A: All of our pools utilize the PPLNS payment system. PPLNS
              is short for "Pay Per Last N Shares". The image below
              illustrates the system.<br> One round has an arbitrary
              number of shares which is solely based on sheer luck.
              Proportional reward systems only consider shares of one
              round when calculating rewards. <br>PPLNS however, uses a
              quite constant number N of shares for calculating
              rewards. This number N changes only with the difficulty:
            </p>
            <img alt="PPLNS" src="@/assets/img/shares_round.png" style="width:100%;max-width: 500px;">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
              As you know the number of shares needed to solve a block
              within a round is different. Round one and three needed
              (difficulty * 2) shares to be solved.<br> Round two and four
              are quite short rounds. There were less than (difficulty
              * 2) shares necessary to solve them. <br>Round five however
              is a very long round which means the pool needed more
              than (difficulty * 2) shares to solve the block. From
              this follows that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rounds one and three are like proportional rounds. All
                of your shares from the given round are considered for
                reward calculations
              </li>
              <li>
                For rounds two and four, shares from the previous
                rounds are considered for calculations as well (marked
                green). <br>In other words: regardless of round boundaries
                we always consider the last
                <em>(difficulty * 2)</em> shares.<br> Your portion of the
                amount of shares is used to calculate your reward.
              </li>
              <li>
                Round five however is very long.In this round your
                lowermost shares (within the marked red part) are
                silently dropped if they are not within the last
                <em>(difficulty * 2)</em> shares.
              </li>
            </ul>

              <strong>PPLNS favors constant and/or occasional loyal pool
                members over pool hoppers.
              </strong>
              <br>Pool hoppers are betting for a "quick win" (like round
              two above) with low shares per round. <br>If the round
              exceeds a certain amount of shares they "hop" to another
              proportional pool which started a new round more
              recently. <br>This assures better rewards for pool hoppers
              over occasional or constant miners which are loyal to
              their pool. <br>Pool hopping however implies that pool
              hoppers need to know when a round is started and how
              much shares are considered for reward.<br>This is very easy
              with proportional reward system. While using PPLNS, this
              is no longer true. <br>On long rounds (like round five
              above) the pool hoppers shares won’t be considered for
              reward calculations in favor of loyal miners.<br> This is
              due to the fact that pool hoppers only mine on the
              beginning of rounds. On short and normal rounds pool
              hoppers won’t lose their shares. <br>Due to the fact that
              shares from previous rounds from loyal miners are
              considered twice (or even more often on extremely short
              rounds) <br>the pool hopper won’t get the same reward as
              from proportional reward system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Assuming blocks have been found, payouts are processed
              and send every 10 minutes. This process is fully automated.

            <p>
              You won't see any balance in your account until a block
              has been found by the pool and after the block has
              reached a mature status. <br>This may take a couple hours,
              depending on the coin. As soon as a block can be
              considered 'mature' by the pool,<br> your shares will be
              used to calculate your contribution towards finding the
              block. The more you've contributed, <br>the higher your cut
              of the block reward will be. Your cut of the block
              reward will then be credited to your pending balance.<br> If
              your balance reaches or exceeds the pool's minimum
              payout amount, the pool will transfer your
              <b>entire</b> balance to your wallet and
              <b>reset</b> your pending balance to zero. <br>The minimum
              payout for each pool is listed in its 'Pool Stats' area.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are a small pool for the time being, and as such it
              may take some time to find a block.<br> On larger pools you
              would see some balance earlier because they will find
              blocks faster, <br>but you will get a smaller share of the
              reward than what you would in a smaller pool.<br> Over time
              you will earn more or less the same amount when mining
              on a large pool or on a small one.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, the rewards you get on average are
              exactly proportional to your part in the total work done
              by the pool. <br>If you mine in a pool
              <strong>twice as large</strong>, the pool will collect
              twice as much rewards but your share in them will be
              <strong>cut by half</strong>, meaning you get the same
              on average.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trustworthiness, reliability, support and low latency
              are the things you should consider when choosing a pool.
              <br>By avoiding the largest pools you contribute to the
              network health by spreading the hash power.
